This is a sample library application that is developed using GO as a preliminary quest to write rest-apis in Golang.

This application has different modules that does its own respective jobs but is mainly confined to the idea of book managements and
no subsequent major moudles like a User profile is incorporated which can be done in the subsequent iterations.

This application uses a Postgres db which is hosted with the help of Elephantsql which is maintained in cloud.
