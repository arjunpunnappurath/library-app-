This is a sample library application that is developed using GO as a preliminary quest to write rest-apis in Golang.
This is a single page application which can be further disected into a project with modules for api calls, business layer and a db repo.

This application uses a Postgres db which is hosted with the help of Elephantsql which is maintained in cloud.
